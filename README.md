Bit Stuffing and Destuffing Demo
 This project demonstrates bit stuffing and destuffing with a modern React frontend.

 ## Setup
 1. **Python Backend**:
    - Run `bit_stuff_destuff.py` to test the backend logic.
    - Requires Python 3.x.
 2. **Frontend**:
    - Open `index.html` in a browser to use the React app.
    - No additional setup required (uses CDN for React and Tailwind).

 ## Deployment
 - Push to GitHub.
 - Use GitHub Pages for the frontend:
   - Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings.
   - Set the source to the `main` branch.
